import { UploadRequest, UploadStorage, UploadOptions } from "../../upload";
import { NgxFileUploadFactory } from "../../utils";

@Compononent({
    template: `
        <-- bind file browser directive to any element -->
        <div class="fileupload" ngxFileUpload (add)="onFilesDrop($event)">
            drag drop files here or click
        </div>

        <div class="fileupload list>
            <ngx-fileupload-item *ngFor="let upload of uploads" [upload]="upload"></ngx-fileupload-item>
        </div>
    `,
    selector: 'app-upload-component'
})
class UploadComponent implements OnInit {

    public uploads: UploadRequest[];

    public storage: UploadStorage;

    private destroyed: Subject<boolean> = new Subject();

    public constructor(
        @Inject(NgxFileUploadFactory) private uploadFactory: NgxFileUploadFactory
    ) {
        this.storage = new UploadStorage();
    }

    public ngOnInit() {
        this.storage.change
            .pipe(takeUntil(this.destroyed))
            .subscribe((uploads: UploadRequest[]) => this.uploads = uploads);
    }

    public ngOnDestroy() {
        this.destroyed.next(true);
        this.storage.destroy();
    }

    /**
